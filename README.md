Stack Overflow Classification Model

Problem: Stack Overflow is a website where developers can ask and answer questions about programming. However, the quality of questions and answers on the site can vary widely. Some questions are well-written and easy to understand, while others are poorly written and difficult to follow.

Solution: I created a classification model that could be used to classify Stack Overflow questions. The model was trained on a dataset of over 7k questions, and it was able to achieve an accuracy of 90%.

Benefits: The model helped to improve the quality of questions and answers on Stack Overflow. By classifying questions, the model was able to identify questions that were poorly written or difficult to understand. This allowed other developers to provide better answers to those questions, which improved the overall quality of the site.
